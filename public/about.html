<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Yu Jie, a university student from Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) who is
taking the Design and Artificial Intelligence (DAI) course. I have worked with a client (Gebirah) to
code a web application and mobile application to aid pregnant women in Singapore. However, while working
with my team, I realised that I only had the skills for basic coding and had very little knowledge about
the intricacies of web development. Hence, I decided to take up this Web Development course to enhance
my skills and lay a solid foundation for future projects.</p>
